                   It is necessary to create a PHP application that users who log in will have access to admin panel.
                   The application is used to display a list of movies from the database that is entered into the form
                   the same.
                   All films should be displayed in the admin panel, in the form of a table. That table should have
                  columns for the title, year and genre of the film, as well as a column for additional options.
                  A column for additional options is needed to contain an icon for edit and delete. Below the table you
                  need to make a form that is used to add new one movies.
                  Repeat the same for genres, of course on a separate page.
                  When changing a film, it is possible to change all its fields (title, year, genre), provided that
                  the genre is selected from the dropdown menu, ie the drop-down list, this must be dynamic, ie. 
                  to genres read from the database.
                   Keep in mind that each film should be described by title, year, and genre.
                   Also, it is necessary to create a special section in the admin panel for user editing, at
                   to which you need to add an image upload function.
                   For maximum number of points: Validate all forms via AJAX. Also on occasion
                   deleting a genre requires that movies in that category also be deleted automatically.
